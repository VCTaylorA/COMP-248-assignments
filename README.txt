these were my solutions for an introductory university course on Object Oriented Programming Using Java.

if you are an instructor of the university, and you would like me to take these down, please let me know at vctaylora@gmail.com. im under the impression that since this is my own licensed work, that i have a right to post my own solutions.


if you notice errors, feel free to make a pull request. honestly, these were hastily put together and have errors, especially assignment 4.
